# User Driven Neighborhood Architecture Map

This is an application used for plotting and viewing architecturally interesting buildings in a neighborhood. Users can view POI's, add new POI's and modify existing ones. User's upload an image, enter their location if not automatically found, add a note and categorize the building.

## Purpose of Application
