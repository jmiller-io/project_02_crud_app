# Architectural.ly

This is an application used for plotting and viewing architecturally interesting buildings in a neighborhood. This can be used to curate self-guided neighborhood architecture tours. Users can view POI's, add new POI's and modify existing ones. User's upload an image, enter their location if not automatically found, add a note and categorize the building.


## User Stories
While out and about a neighborhood, users can snap a picture, enter in other relevent information and submit the posting to add a marker to the map. Users can also modify existing information or delete it from the database.


## Purpose of Application
This is the second project built while attending a Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. This project demostrates my understanding of CRUD operations performed on databases, in this case MongoDB. This project also demonstrates my understanding of HTTP requests and routing using Node.js.
